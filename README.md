# Mutsi_front_end

This is a small front-end project to demonstrate basic javascript functionalities, API usage and calls, and HTML/CSS.

There is a small blurb about my dog as well as 3 displaying divs that show her routine in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

1. The title div is fixed.
2. The clock divs' displays are toggled on and off.
3. The morning div displays a drop down menu that triggers acorrect or incorrect response. When the default option is selected, the response does not show. 
4. The afternoon div displays dog images queried from a random dog public API. 
5. The evening div displays a dog-calculator, which was the only element created prior to this morning. I coded a binary calculator earlier this week, and I transformed the binary calculator into a special dog calculator for this page.
