# Mutsi_front_end

This is a small front-end project to demonstrate basic javascript functionalities, API usage and calls, and HTML/CSS.

There is a small blurb about my dog as well as 3 displaying divs that show her routine in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

1. The divs' displays are toggled on and off.
2. The morning div displays a drop down menu that triggers acorrect or incorrect response. When the default option is selected, the response does not show. 
3. The afternoon div displays dog images queried from a random dog public API. 
4. The evening div displays a dog-calculator, which was the only element created prior to this morning. I coded a binary calculator earlier this week, and I transformed the binary calculator into a special dog calculator for this page.
